# My changes
- Added split shield encoder
- Added docker compose for easy build

## How to use docker compose build
1. Check the mount location of `/usr/app/zmk-config:ro` in `docker-compose.yml`. Point to your zmk-config directory in your system.
1. Run `docker compose up`
2. SSH into the container by (probably in another shell) : `docker compose exec zmk bash`
3. In the SSH session, run `bash build.sh`
